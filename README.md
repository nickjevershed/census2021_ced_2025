# Census variables by 2025 CED (commonwealth electoral districts)

For some reason the ABS has only made Census data for the latest electoral boundaries available via the [Digital Atlas of Australia](https://digital.atlas.gov.au/apps/102094cea83741a2b3d3cc90458f2aee/explore) and it is otherwise very annoying to calculate certain things from Tablebuilder even if you have a correspondence file, so here is the exported census data from the Digital Atlas. Enjoy, use at your own risk, etc etc.
